What’s ely.io all about? I am ely and this is my home online for self-expression, for intellectual exploration and for showing my creative process for design and development as well as making physical products with fabric, electronics and more. I have been writing about these subjects for more than a decade but with a few exceptions I have not felt that the right place existed for publication of my words. Social media has encouraged a lot of people to put their thoughts online but for me it doesn’t offer the right amount of control and ownership of my content and that is what I hope this will be.
